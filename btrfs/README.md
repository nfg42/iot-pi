# Pi BTRFS
## This is not a full guide on how to setup btrfs on a pi, this is just a note to myself. Make sure you understand the commands before using them.

This is how I converted Ubuntu 20.04 on a pi to btrfs. A second linux computer is needed for the conversion. The SD card was located at /dev/sdd2 for this setup.
